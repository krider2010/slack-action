# Post Slack messages

This action wraps the Slack [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) API method for posting to channels, private groups, and DMs. This action sends messages using [Slack bot tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types), which have two main advantages compared to user tokens and incoming webhooks: (1) Bots can't be disabled inadvertently when a Slack user is disabled or removed. Slack has written about this in a [recent announcement](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/the-latest-with-app-tokens-fe878d44130c), and (2) Bots offer a [powerful range of capabilities](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) that can be leveraged to perform more functions.

## Usage:

```workflow
action "Post message to Slack" {
  uses = "pullreminders/slack-action@master"
  secrets = [
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN",
  ]
  args = "{\"channel\":\"C1234567890\",\"text\":"Hello world"}"
}
```

Here's what the Slack message would look like:

## Alternative Usage

If you want to create a message conditionally on previous actions in the same workflow, you can make use of the shared workspace that is persisted throughout a flow being run. You would do that by removing args and setting an environment variable.

```workflow
action "Post message to Slack" {
  uses = "pullreminders/slack-action@master"
  secrets = [
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"
  ]
  env = {
      MESSAGE_FILE = "slack-message.json"
  }
}
```

In which case it would look for a file named $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/slack-message.json and expect that to be the JSON payload to send to Slack. This JSON file should be formatted as documented below.

A simple example of this JSON file to match the args example would be:
```json
{
    channel: "C1234567890",
    text: "Hello world"
}
```

This is a good way of getting values from previous actions in a workflow to use in messages sent to Slack.

## Setup

To use this GitHub Action you'll first need to create a Slack App and install it to your Slack workspace.

### Creating a Slack App

1. **Create a Slack App**. Go to [Slack's developer site](https://api.slack.com/apps) then click "Create an app". Name the app "GitHub Action" (you can change this later) and make sure your team's Slack workspace is selected under "Development Slack Workspace" ([see screenshot](docs/images/slack-app.png)).
2. **Add a Bot user**. Browse to the "Bot users" page listed in the sidebar. Name your bot "GitHub Action" (you can change this later) and leave the other default settings as-is ([see screenshot](docs/images/bot-user.png)).
3. **Set an icon for your bot.** Browse to the "Basic information" page listed in the sidebar. Scroll down to the section titled "Display information" to set an icon. Feel free to use one of the [icons in this repository](docs/app-icons).
4. **Install your app to your workspace.** At the top of the "Basic information" page you can find a section titled "Install your app to your workspace". Click on it, then use the button to complete the installation ([see screenshot](docs/images/install-slack-all.png)).

## Using the action

To use this GitHub Action, you'll need to set a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secret on GitHub. To get your Slack bot token, browse to the "OAuth & Permissions" page listed in Slack and copy the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" beginning in `xoxb-`.

### Posting messages

Slack's [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) method accepts a JSON payload containing options â€” this JSON payload should be supplied as the argument in your GitHub Action. At a bare minimum, your payload must include a channel ID and the message. Here's what a basic message might look like:

```workflow
action "Post message to Slack" {
  uses = "pullreminders/slack-github-action@master"
  secrets = [
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN",
  ]
  args = "{\"channel\":\"C1234567890\",\"text\":"Hello world"}"
}
```

Please note that if you are using the visual editor you should not escape quotes because GitHub will automatically escape them for you.

#### Channel IDs

A "channel ID" can be the ID of a channel, private group, or user you would like to post a message to. Your bot can message any user in your Slack workspace but needs to be invited into channels and private groups before it can post to them.

If you open Slack in your web browser, you can find channel IDs at the end of the URL when viewing channels and private groups. Note that this doesn't work for direct messages.

```
https://myworkspace.slack.com/messages/CHANNEL_ID/
```

You can also find channel IDs using the Slack API. Get a list of channels that your bot is a member of via Slack's [users.conversations](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.conversations) endpoint. Get user IDs for direct messages using Slack's [users.lookupByEmail](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.lookupByEmail) endpoint

#### Formatting messages

Please refer to [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages) on message formatting. They also have a [message builder](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder) that's great for playing around and previewing messages. Your messages can contain attachments, markdown, buttons, and more.
